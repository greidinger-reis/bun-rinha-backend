# Optimizations

- Using Raw SQL with [pg-typed](https://pgtyped.dev/) instead of [DrizzleORM](https://orm.drizzle.team)
- Using [Typia](https://typia.io/) instead of [Typebox](https://github.com/sinclairzx81/typebox) for validations
- Making object mutations instead of creating new objects
- Returning no data on errors

## There may be more optimizations to be done.
